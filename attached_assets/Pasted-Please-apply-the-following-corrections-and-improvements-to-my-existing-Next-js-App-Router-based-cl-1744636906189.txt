Please apply the following corrections and improvements to my existing Next.js (App Router) based client renewal management application:

🧾 Dashboard Page (app/dashboard)
Upcoming Renewals Table

The table design is currently off. Please:

Improve padding, column spacing, and overall alignment.

Add hover and alternate row styles.

Make headers sticky if content overflows.

Improve readability with clean fonts and background.

Recent Activity

Remove the “Recent Activity” section completely.

Instead, increase the width/height of the “Upcoming Renewals” table to use the freed-up space.

Calendar Display on Dashboard

The calendar is either broken or appears defective.

Ensure a properly styled, functional calendar preview appears in the dashboard (maybe a mini version of the full calendar page).

Consider using a calendar library like FullCalendar for consistency.

🧾 Renewals Page (app/renewals)
Create/Update Functionality

Currently, create and update actions fail.

Fix the form submission logic for:

Validation errors.

API POST/PUT request handling.

Proper UI feedback (success/error).

Make sure the data is correctly saved to and retrieved from the MySQL database.

🗓️ Calendar Page (app/calendar)
Non-functional Calendar

Calendar currently shows only dots without data.

Fix event mapping logic:

Load upcoming renewals from the database.

Map them properly to FullCalendar (or similar).

Each renewal should show client name + service type on the calendar.

Improve calendar styling for better UI.

🧭 Sidebar (Global Navigation)
Logout Button Positioning

The logout tab/button is misaligned and appears hanging in the middle.

Fix its placement so that it:

Stays at the bottom of the sidebar.

Is consistently aligned and styled.

Sidebar Stickiness

Sidebar should be sticky/fixed on the left.

Should not scroll with page content.

Must maintain consistent height and responsive behavior across all screen sizes.

🧪 Additional Notes
Ensure all changes are mobile responsive.

Use TailwindCSS or your current design system (e.g., ShadCN, Radix) consistently.

Confirm that all fixes work seamlessly across pages.
